So, you want to make a Website? This guide is for you! We assume you are a
complete novice who (up until a few seconds ago) had no idea where to start.
Well done; you found it!

There is so much to learn, but we're going to start with the basic building
blocks, and then each section will gradually build on what has come before. But
what shall we build?

## The Guide
This guide will take you, step-by-step, through the process of learning what a
website is and how the web works - all the way to building & deploying your
first website.

We will cover:

- [What is a Website](), what happens when you type a URL in your browser?
- [Plain-text]() and how it makes the Web possible.
- [HTML, CSS and JavaScript fundamentals](): the trifecta of Web Development.
- Website [Content, layout, style and interactivity]().
- [Hosting, deploying & monitoring]() your website.
- [Templates, frameworks and libraries]().
- [User experience, accessibility & attention to details]().
- [Next steps](): what directions can you take from here?

## The Student
Learning to code requires a patience & practice, so it helps to make it fun.
Being overwhelmed isn't fun, and web-development has a lot of moving parts.
Here we assume you know nothing about web-development. In fact, you may not
know what that even means yet. We assume you know nothing about writing code,
or operating a computer to do anything more complex than browsing the web or
using a word-processor:

*   If you can use a word-processor, **you can write code.**
*   If you can browse the web, **you can see what your code does.**

Reading this is proof that you can use a web-browser, so you're halfway there.
If you don't know how to use a word-processor, you should seek information
about how to write & save files. This guide assumes that you have those basics
already.

## In the beginning...
As a web-developer, you will have to understand how to build websites & also
how websites work. How do you want to start? Do you want to understand the
basic ideas first, or do you want to skip ahead and start writing code?

*   I know nothing: [What is a Website?]()
*   I understand about web-browsers and web-pages: [How do I write HTML?]()
