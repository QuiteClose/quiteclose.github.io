*Computer Terminals* are today the mostly-exclusive reserve of coders,
system-operators and enthusiasts. Gone are the hulking CRTs and attached
keyboards of the 1960s. The modern operator relies on software, a *Terminal
Emulator*, to recreate this archaic medium. Those of us who reside with our
terminals, who think, and tinker and create at our terminals still - we don't
need saving! We love our terminals. We love text-based interfaces. We only need
a colour scheme - and for me, that's where [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) comes in.

There's something valuable in Solarized that I want to unpack. For now, though,
please enjoy this humble palette demo:
