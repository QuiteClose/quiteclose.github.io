Many of my earliest memories are from trying to solve problems on the
command-line. Now I'm a professional programmer and it doesn't seem so
different after all.

I'm a (mostly) self-taught programmer. Here are some of the resources that made
the biggest impact on me:

*   [MIT 6.001: Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/)<br>
    Great for coders who want to become software-engineers.
*   [The Art of Unix Programming](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/)<br>
    Learn about the environment.
*   [Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](https://poignant.guide/book/)<br>
    An invitation to program for fun.
*   [The C Programming Language](https://archive.org/details/the-ansi-c-programming-language-by-brian-w.-kernighan-dennis-m.-ritchie.org/page/8/mode/2up)<br>
    All too familiar with the first N pages of this book.
*   [TDD in Python: Obey the Testing Goat!](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc)<br>
    Testing maketh the professional.
