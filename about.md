Many of my earliest memories are from trying to solve problems on the
command-line. Now I'm a professional programmer and it doesn't seem so
different after all. Despite this, I've noticed periods where I've forgotten
the playful curiosity that got me started. Isn't that the way of things, eh?
This website is my attempt to jog my memory a bit.

I'm a (mostly) self-taught programmer. Here are some of the resources that made
the biggest impact on me:

*   [MIT 6.001: Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video_galleries/video-lectures/)<br>
    Great for coders who want to become software-engineers.
*   [The Art of Unix Programming](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/)<br>
    Learn about the environment.
*   [Don't Make Me Think](https://eng317hannah.wordpress.ncsu.edu/files/2020/01/Krug_Steve_Dont_make_me_think_revisited___a_cz-lib.org_.pdf)<br>
    Fundamentals of UI useability.
*   [Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](https://poignant.guide/book/)<br>
    An invitation to program for fun.
*   [The C Programming Language](https://archive.org/details/the-ansi-c-programming-language-by-brian-w.-kernighan-dennis-m.-ritchie.org/page/8/mode/2up)<br>
    All too familiar with the first N pages of this book.
*   [TDD in Python: Obey the Testing Goat!](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html#toc)<br>
    Testing maketh the professional.
